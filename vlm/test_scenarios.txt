Scene 1 Against traffic
You are controlling a robot navigating inside a crowded pedestrian area.

Scene:
- The robot is moving in the opposite direction of pedestrian flow.
- Multiple pedestrians are walking toward the robot.
- Closest pedestrian ≈ 2 meters.
- Speed of oncoming pedestrians ≈ 0.8 m/s.
- Robot speed ≈ 0.6 m/s.

Social rules:
- Avoid blocking oncoming traffic.
- Prefer passing on the right-hand side.
- Slow down or yield when pedestrian density is high.
- Maintain at least 0.5–1.0 m interpersonal distance.


Scene 2 With Traffic
You are controlling a robot navigating among pedestrians moving in the same direction.

Scene:
- Robot is moving with pedestrian flow.
- Pedestrians ahead walking slower than the robot.
- Average spacing ≈ 1.5 m.
- Robot speed ≈ 0.8 m/s, pedestrian speed ≈ 0.3–0.5 m/s.

Social rules:
- Do not tailgate or crowd pedestrians.
- Maintain smooth flow by adjusting speed.
- Pass slower pedestrians on the left if space allows.


Scene 3 Street Crossing
You are controlling a robot crossing a street with pedestrian activity.

Scene:
- Robot intends to cross from one side of the street to the other.
- Pedestrians crossing from both directions.
- Some oncoming pedestrians may intersect the robot’s path.
- Distance to nearest pedestrian ≈ 2 m.

Social rules:
- Yield to crossing pedestrians.
- Avoid abrupt acceleration.
- Maintain safe crossing trajectory.


Scene 4 Overtaking
You are controlling a robot overtaking a slow-moving pedestrian or group.

Scene:
- Robot is behind a pedestrian or group walking slowly ahead.
- Overtaking space available on left or right depending on scenario width.
- Distance to slow-moving pedestrian ≈ 1.5 m.

Social rules:
- Maintain safe lateral distance while overtaking.
- Pass smoothly without startling pedestrians.
- Avoid cutting too close in front after overtaking.


Scene 5 Sidewalk
You are controlling a robot navigating on a sidewalk.

Scene:
- Robot moves along a straight sidewalk path.
- One or more pedestrians appear either ahead or opposing.
- Sidewalk width ≈ 2–3 m.

Social rules:
- Pass on the left when overtaking.
- Keep right when meeting pedestrians head-on.
- Maintain comfortable interpersonal distance.


Scene 6 Passing Conversational Groups
You are controlling a robot navigating past a conversational group (2+ people).

Scene:
- A group of pedestrians are standing and talking.
- They partially block the robot's intended path.
- There is free space on one or both sides of the group.

Social rules:
- Avoid entering the conversation group's personal space.
- Pass around the group, not between group members.
- Maintain polite distance (≥1 m preferred).


Scene 7 Blind Corner
You are controlling a robot approaching a blind corner where visibility is limited.

Scene:
- Robot approaches a corner where pedestrians may appear unexpectedly.
- No direct line of sight beyond the corner.
- Speed ≈ 0.5 m/s.

Social rules:
- Slow down near blind corners.
- Prepare to yield to unseen pedestrians.
- Avoid aggressive turning.


Scene 8 Narrow Doorway
You are controlling a robot navigating through a narrow doorway.

Scene:
- Doorway width is limited; only one person can pass at a time.
- A human is near the doorway and may pass first.
- Robot should avoid rushing or blocking.

Social rules:
- Wait for the human to pass before entering.
- Maintain respectful distance.
- Do not squeeze through simultaneously.


Scene 9 Crossing Stationary Queue
You are controlling a robot crossing a line of stationary people.

Scene:
- A queue of people is standing shoulder-to-shoulder.
- Robot wants to cross perpendicular to the line.
- Gaps between people may be small.

Social rules:
- Do not attempt to squeeze between people.
- Walk around the queue unless a clearly open gap exists.
- Yield to people already in the queue.


Scene 10 Stairs
You are controlling a robot navigating near or on stairs.

Scene:
- Robot approaching stairs or descending them.
- Pedestrians may be ascending or descending.
- Space is constrained.

Social rules:
- Avoid blocking stairway flow.
- Give priority to ascending pedestrians.
- Maintain slow and controlled motion.

Scene 11 Stair
You are controlling a robot navigating near a parked or moving vehicle.

Scene:
- A car or small vehicle is present near the robot's path.
- Person may exit or enter the vehicle.
- Robot must avoid getting too close.

Social rules:
- Keep safe distance from vehicles (>1 m recommended).
- Yield to people interacting with the vehicle.
- Avoid crossing close to vehicle blind spots.


Scene 12 Navigating Through Large Crowds
You are controlling a robot navigating through a dense and unstructured crowd.

Scene:
- Large number of pedestrians with unpredictable movement.
- Close spacing (0.5–1 m).
- Robot’s planned path may frequently be obstructed.

Social rules:
- Move slowly and cautiously.
- Maintain maximal interpersonal comfort.
- Yield to pedestrians whenever ambiguous situations arise.
